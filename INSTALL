In order to install Ino from source tarball run:

    make install

By default Ino is installed into `/usr/local'. You can change this by setting
PREFIX or DESTDIR variables.

    * DESTDIR changes file system root (`/' by default)
    * PREFIX sets installation prefix (`/usr/local` by default).

Examples:

    * make install DESTDIR=~/ino
    * make install PREFIX=/usr

If you would like to use Bash completion for ino's subcommands and arguments,
have a look at the instructions in `bash-completion/ino'.
